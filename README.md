You should access a website, and by clicking the button "Generate Password" you will be able to give your preferences for your password :
- How many characters (between 8 and 128)
- What kind of characters (lowercase, uppercase, number, special characters)

# Instructions and Challenges
- Use functions
- Use for loops
- Use conditionnal statements
- Use eventListeners
- Use querySelectors

# Future Improvements
- Divide the main function in multiple functions, to get a reusable code
